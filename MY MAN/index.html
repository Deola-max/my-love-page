    <h1>For You My Love ❤️</h1>
    <div class="message">
        My obim, <br>
        Even though miles separate us, my heart beats only for you. <br> Every message from you is like a spark that sets my soul on fire,<br> and every call feels like you're right here, whispering sweet words into my ear. <br> I can't see you yet, but I feel you in every moment—in the way my heart races when I think of you, <br> in the way I smile when I read your words, <br> in the way my body aches for the day I'll finally be in your arms. <br>

        I imagine what it will be like when we finally meet. <br> How my hands will trace the lines of your face, <br> how my lips will finally taste yours, <br> how every stolen glance will be filled with unspoken desire. <br> Until then, I’ll keep loving you from a distance, <br> dreaming of the day I no longer have to.
        
        You are worth every second of waiting, <br> every longing sigh, and every sleepless night spent missing you. 
        <br>
        If only you knew the things I want to do to you when we're finally together... <br> but for now, I'll let your imagination drive you crazy." 😘
        You are the most amazing person in my life. <br> Every day with you is a blessing, and I am so grateful for your love
        <p>You are worth every second of waiting...</p>
        <p><strong>Always yours,</strong><br> Your Love Adeola❤️</p>
